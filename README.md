# Scripts

Collection of my scripts.

## Installation

If you want to use these scripts, remember to adapt them for your own needs as
some are refined to my configurations.

To install simply clone the repository and move theses scripts to somewhere in
your $PATH, e.g.:

```console
git clone https://github.com/caprilesport/scripts 
mv scripts ~                                            # Location to move the folder, I use it in ~
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/scripts' >> ~/.bashrc     # Or ~/.zshrc if you use zsh
```

Most scripts are self describing. Read them to bette grasp what they do.

`gdrive` is used to synchronize files with google drive, the
[original](https://github.com/lmiq/tips/blob/master/GoogleDrive/gdrive) was made
by [Prof. Leandro Martinez](https://github.com/lmiq).
